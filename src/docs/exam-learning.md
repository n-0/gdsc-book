# Tips for exam preparation

In our latest GDSC event (*02/23/22*) we discussed our biannually
favorite marathon, the exam phase and collected some links that shall guide
you in your preparation (especially at the best uni TUH). We recommend you to
use the bookmark function for this page of your browser (and share it with your accounts on other devices).
To have quick access to the most useful resources in two clicks.

### [Learning infrastructure](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/lehre/lerninfrastruktur.html)
It's the equivalent of this page from this TUH and has a collection
of important links.

### [Center for education and learning](https://www2.tuhh.de/zll/?lang=en)
General information for training of professors, but also about thesis subjects
and links to connect to other international students for [study groups](https://www.tuhh.de/welcome/de/kompetenzen/studybuddy.html).

### [Study plans](https://studienplaene.tuhh.de/index.php)
You can enter your subject and start of degree to get a list
of your core qualifications, example schedules and more detailed information about modules.
We especially recommend the info about modules as you can find helpful references to books
that the course is based on (e.g. Signal & Systems from Oppenheimer at MIT)

### [TUNE Modulplan mit Belegungen](https://tune.tuhh.de/qisserver/pages/cm/exa/enrollment/info/start.xhtml)
Love or hate it our new portal for study services has quite a lot of features and
allows you to register for a subject, exam (please don't forget to register on time) and
print your [achievements](https://tune.tuhh.de/qisserver/pages/sul/examAssessment/personExamsReadonly.xhtml) so that you can hang them on your wall or give it to your future imaginary
employeer.

### [StudIP](https://e-learning.tuhh.de)
We would be suprised if you could go around studying without it, but for completeness,
the portal we all the material like lecture slides and homeworks are stored.

### [Pauls math notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu)
It's a good guide with exercises about typical topics
you encounter in a math related curriculum. Paul really made
beautiful and easy to read summaries of things like Analysis (convergence of series),
differential equations among other things.

### [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)
This page is a must have for everyone who calls
them proudly a nerd or works with computers. Detailed
info for courses like technical computer science or
algorithms can be found here.

### [MIT Open Course Ware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.html)
It's one of the most prestigous universities of the world
and not without reason, as they have beautiful courses that
are often inspirations for ours (e.g. Mathe 3 is based on Multivariate
calculus). You can find full lecture recordings, homework and slides for free
on their website.


### [Anki for flash cards](https://apps.ankiweb.net)
If you study a MINT course (except for biology) you rather
prefer understanding things versus memorizing them by heart.
Nevertheless there are subjects that require you to store details
like your brain is some sort of encyclopedia, hence a tool
like Anki can make this easier and even put some fun into it, while
using the principle of spaced repititions to your advantage.

### [devhints.io](https://devhints.io)
devhints.io is useful website to get cheat sheets.
you benefit from this cheat sheets especially in our
more job orientated courses (e.g. introduction to c, functional programming etc.).

### Tech docs
We want to emphasize while a course in our university or on udemy
is helpful to get a first taste of what you need to know about a technology,
it is necessary to go a little deeper below the analogies and simple examples
to use them in real life. Therefore you should always get comfortable with reading
the docs of the originators and maybe event the source code sometimes (e.g. for libraries).
Examples are the python docs or [cpp reference](https://en.cppreference.com) for matters like Introduction to Security or
Object Orientated Programming.


### [Video conferencing](zoom.us)
In times of COVID we learned once more that we have be creative in how we learn
and communicate together. Fortunately the TUH gave everyone a full premium account
on zoom, and even though it is less shiny than discord it is more than enough for most
study group purposes.

### [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com)
We all know this. You have been stuck on an exercise
and tempted to look at the solution. DON'T. Rather
skip this one and go to the next or find hints. Another possibility
is to get an initial step from WolframAlpha or get some interesting infromation
about the function you're looking at (e.g. level surfaces).


### Some general notes
Google is a powerful search engine, but it needs to be used
correctly to get the data that you want. For example using a more
keyword based query instead of a full fledged sentence is often
easier to understand for algorithm. Furthermore using english
and setting search results to a region like USA can add higher
quality content to the result. Also if you search for certain books
keywords like pdf can give you direct links to the press of universities.

Sometimes there's to much on the plate that you can remember all the dates
therefore use a schedular app like Google's and keep it sorted! We mean that,
if you don't use the imported calendar of the TUH, because you don't attend all lectures
in person remove them from your calendar and add by hand the dates. Set reminders for important
deadlines and dates.

And here some words from our experts, who we want to thank for they great input üôè

## Imke
Math graduate of the university of hamburg who achieved her degree in 3 years and top grades

1. Summarizing and notes
2. Talk with others about topics
3. Calculate exerices
4. Don't cram, especially on the night before the exam
5. Ask tutors and Profs


## Dominik

One of our top students in computer science, who is not only beating every exam, but also did his Abitur with 1.0
1. Put away distractions (phone), for deep focus time (don't learn half way 8 h because that's actually 4h)
2. Summarizing can be prograstination (not solving exercises or really applying knowledge or missing repitition)
3. Switch from ipad to pen and paper before exam, because digital is much faster in more error prone (for pen and paper think before writing)
4. Do a simulation of the exam. If you have old exams just use one with time measuring, otherwise create one yourself from homework exercises etc.
5. Keep a regular sleep cycle that fits with the exams (same goes with eating enough and other self/health care)
Everyone got their own way of saving information and preparing, but there are some general considerations and patterns applying to a student.


## Julian

Another of our top tier cs graduates, who is always a good inspiration for ideas
1. exercises can be quite similar to what is requested in the exam
2. Don't read solutions for a simulated exam
